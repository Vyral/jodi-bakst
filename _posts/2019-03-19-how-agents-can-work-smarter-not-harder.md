Motivated real estate agents strive for sustained success. Though we all work hard, not all of us are working smart. **Here are three tips to help you become more efficient as an agent:**

1. **Associate with a broker.** Choose one who can inspire you and is also a known marketer; the real estate business is much more about marketing than sales. If you don’t have a strong pipeline of business, you won’t be able to find much work. A good broker will help you put the systems in place and give you the detailed, dedicated coaching needed to succeed.
2. **Leverage other people’s success.** There are many ways to do real estate: You could work by referral only, you could go door knocking, and you could use technology for lead generation. They all work, but I take a personalized approach to help my agents find and use the tools that work best for them. It’s not a one-size-fits-all business.
3. **Be independent and do your business with purpose.** Working smarter means finding the systems that work for you and utilizing them. You must work actively in your business—depending on someone else for leads is a bad idea. It’s fine when you’re a new agent, but over time, you want to learn how to do it independently.

While we always strive to go above and beyond for our clients, we do the same thing for our agents. As an independent company, we have the flexibility to choose the systems and tools that help us work smarter, not harder. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
