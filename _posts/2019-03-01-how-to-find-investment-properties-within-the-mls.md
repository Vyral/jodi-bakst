Many investors think that the way to find the best investment properties is by using off-market sources (foreclosures, probate properties, etc.). The statistics, though, say something different.

Nationally, 83% of all investment properties are found in the MLS. On a local scale, in the last year, 310 investment deals with a 25% increase in value (or a purchase price with a 75% after-repair value) were found in the Triangle market using the MLS.

**Knowing that, the Real Estate Experts team has partnered with Privy™, a company that provides software that allows you to find great investment deals within the MLS.** Today I’m joined by Benson Juarez, the company’s director of operations and business development, to talk about how Privy™ was developed and how it can benefit you. &nbsp;

According to Benson, Privy™ was built as a way to help them with their own real estate investment clients. They were spending too much time behind their computers trying to find and analyze deals, and the process was becoming cumbersome. With Privy™ software at their fingertips, investors can analyze deals on their own timeline and not rely so heavily on their agent.
