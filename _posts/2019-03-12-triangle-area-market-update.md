Real estate numbers tend to lag behind a bit, so the statistics we’re looking at today come from January. However, they can still give us a good look at where our market lies.

**Comparing January 2019’s numbers to last year’s, the market has definitely improved.** Home showings are up 8%, inventory is up 11%, and pending sales are also up 11%. Because we’re still early in the season, however, the number of days on market has increased a bit.

In the Triangle, we have two markets: homes under $500,000 and homes over $500,000. **You can see a complete breakdown of the numbers at 1:05 in the video.**

The market is very hot in Southwest Durham, and properties priced under $350,000 are getting many showings and multiple offers. In Chapel Hill, homes priced under $500,000 are also experiencing many showings and are going under contract quickly.

Overall, the market is improving. Average prices increased year to year across the board—they were up 8% in Chapel Hill, 4% in Durham, and 18% in Cary and Apex. Inventory is still very low, ranging from one to three months’ worth of homes on the market. **That number fluctuates depending on your price range and location.** Homes in the upper price ranges have gone above five months of inventory, for example.

Interest rates are holding steady; 30-year mortgage rates are at about 4.7% and 15-year rates are at 4.25%. This is great news for buyers.

As we move into spring, we need more inventory. **Since there are more buyers out there, it’s a perfect time to put your home on the market.** We’d be more than happy to help you prepare for a sale, answer any questions you have, and provide further information. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
