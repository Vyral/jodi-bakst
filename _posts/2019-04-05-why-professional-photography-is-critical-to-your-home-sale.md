With buyers increasingly starting their home search online, your marketing efforts are actually reaching them all over the world.&nbsp;

**From the outset, buyers want to see pictures of your home**. If one room of your home is messy in any way, it’ll be reflected in the picture online, and buyers have a low tolerance for clutter. Your Realtor will help you position your property with professional photography so that your home is highlighted in its best possible light.&nbsp;

Your Realtor may use a staging service or they may conduct the staging on their own by way of drone footage or virtual staging.

Ultimately, the goal is to have a marketing plan and **professional photography is an incredibly important way for buyers from all over the world, and who are looking in your area, to see your home. &nbsp;**

If you have any questions about professional photography or these types of services, don’t hesitate to be in touch. I’d be happy to help!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
